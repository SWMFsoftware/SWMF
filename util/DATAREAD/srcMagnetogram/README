# How to create a magnetogram input file for SWMF from a raw magnetogram #

##########################################################################

These are the steps for creating a magnetogram file for SWMF from 
any raw magnetogram fits file.

1. Install SWMF (Config.pl -install).
2. Compile the HARMONICS executable by typing:
	make HARMONICS
in the directory SWMF_path/util/DATAREAD/srcMagnetogram. This will 
create the HARMONICS.exe executable in the directory SWMF_path/bin

3. For convenient, you can create a link to this executable from the path
SWMF_path/util/DATAREAD/srcMagnetogram by typing:
	ln -s ../../../bin/HARMONICS.exe HARMONICS.exe
4. Type:
	cp your_magnetoram_file.fits fitsfile.fits
5. Convert the fits file to ASCII format by running the idl program 
run_fits_to_ascii.pro. You will be asked to insert the maximum order of 
harmonics and the Carrington Rotation number. It is recommended (but not 
required ) to use not more than 90 harmonics, since the computation time 
can be very long. 
   The idl routine generates three files:
	*fitsfile.dat - ASCII file to be used by HARMONICS.exe to calculate 
	 the harmonic coefficients.
	*fitsfile.H - the header of the original fits file with information 
	 about the magnetogram source.
	*fitsfile_tec.dat - a Tecplot file to display the original magnetogram.
6. Run HARMONICS.exe. This executable can be run in parallel mode for faster 
computation. This run will generate a file called harmonics.dat that 
can be used in SWMF. For convenient, it is recommended to rename the file with 
the following naming format:
	cp harmonics.dat CRxxxx_OBS.dat
where xxxx is the Carrington Rotation number and OBS is the observatory name 
(MDI,WSO,MWO,GONG etc.)
7. Move the magnetogram harmonics file to the path defined in the PFSSM flag 
in PARAM.in file (usually run/SC).
