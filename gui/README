The SWMF Graphical User Interface (GUI) runs an independant web server, 
owned by the user who installs it, with a high port number (defaults to 8080).
From the main SWMF directory, type 

make GUI

to compile and install the web server. Then type 

make GUI_doc

to install SWMF documentation in the GUI and 

make GUI_start

to launch the webserver. 

Alternatively, you can execute the following commands in the gui directory:

./install.sh 8080
./makemanual.sh
./start.sh

Point a web browser to machinename:8080/ to use it.

To stop the web server type

make GUI_stop

or 

cd gui
./stop.sh
