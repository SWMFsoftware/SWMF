The files for the slices are called SliceXnnnnVAR.jpg where X is either the X, Y, or Z slice, nnnn is the position of the slice and VAR is the variable plotted.

The range for the X slices is -40 to 40 in x and -30 to 30 in y.
The range for the Y and Z slices is -50 to 30 in x and -30 to 30 in y.

The "rho" variable is density, with a range of 0 to 28.
The "ux" variable is the x component of velocity, with a range of -400 to +400
The "p" variable is pressure, with a range of 0 to 0.2
The "jy" variable is the y component of the current, with a range of -0.0005 to +0.0005

Blue is the lowest contour value and red is the highest.

The files Slice3D0000rho.jpg is the same as SliceZ0000rho.jpg with the addition of the magnetic field lines also shown.

The file tpBatch_LastClosed.dat.wrl is the VRML file of the field lines.
