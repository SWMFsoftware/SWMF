The content of this chapter is generated from the Param/PARAM.XML file
of the CON module and the PARAM.XML files
in the component version directories (e.g. UA/GITM2/PARAM.XML). 
These XML files can be read with an editor and they can be used
for creating PARAM.in files by copying small parts from them.

The XML files have been written by several developers at the
Center of Space Environment Modeling. The transformation of the XML
format into LaTex is done with the share/Scripts/XmlToTex.pl
script. This script generates index terms for all commands,
which are used to create an alphabetical index at the end of this chapter.
